## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Document scope and purpose

This rulebook defines the requirements and constrains pertaining to EHIC PuB-EAAs as used within social security coordination in Europe.

### 1.2 Document structure

- Chapter 2, which describes the attestation attributes and metadata in an 
encoding-independent manner. 
- Chapter 3, which specifies how the attestation
attributes and metadata are encoded in case the attestation complies with [ISO/IEC
18013-5] and/or [SD-JWT VC] and/or [W3C VCDM v2.0]. 
- Chapter 4, which specifies attestation usage.
- Chapter 5, which defines trust anchors
- Chapter 6, which defines revocation mechanisms
- Chapter 7, which provides compliance information

### 1.3 Key words

This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in [RFC 2119], i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.

In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, i.e., a requirement that is not mandated by this document, but, for
instance, by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability,
whereas other words, such as 'will', and 'is' or 'are' are intended as
statements of fact.

### 1.4 Terminology

This document uses the terminology specified in Annex 1 of the ARF.

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE THE ATTRIBUTES AND THEIR VALUES INCLUDED IN THE EXAMPLE]

### 3.2 SD-JWT VC-based encoding 

Finally, illustrative examples SHALL be included. 

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF THE JWT CLAIM SET USED BY THE PROVIDER]

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUED SD-JWT (IN base64 ENCODING)]

AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURES INCLUDED IN THE EXAMPLE]


## 4 Attestation usage
*Briefly describe the primary use cases or scenarios for which this attestation 
type is intended*

*Additionally, in this section it SHOULD  be specified whether a Relying Party receiving the attestation
must request and verify a PID (see ARB_27 in [Topic 12]). Also beyond PID verification, 
it SHOULD be defined what other key obligations does a Relying Party have when processing 
this attestation type (e.g., signature verification, freshness checks)*

*Furthermore, provide potential presentation requirements, e.g., are there specific 
requirements for how this attestation must be presented (e.g., online, offline, specific protocols)?"*

*Finally, in this section information about potential transactional data
SHALL be defined (see [Topic 20] of Annex 2 of the ARF).*

## 5 Trust anchors

Trust anchors for EHIC PuB-EAAs are the same as defined in the common rulebook.

## 6 Revocation

Revocation patterns for EHIC PuB-EAAs are the same as defined in the common rulebook.

## 7 Compliance
